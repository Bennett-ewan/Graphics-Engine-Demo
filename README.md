# 3D Engine Demo

Here you will find my C++ 3D custom engine demo that will be updated regularly

## Use

Inside the Assets folder is where you will be making edits. If you desire to add more 3D objects into the engine, you need to create .obj and .mtl files (Best used in conjunction with Blender). Place these in inside the Models folder in it's own folder with the models name. It will automatically show up in engine when creating a new object.

Opon starting the engine, a scene called "ArchetypeEditor" is already created. This is where you will create blueprints of objects to place into your world. Once you create an archetype, you need to add a model component for it to render. After a model is created, you can add different combination of shapes or models to create your archetype. Then simply go back to your level and place your objects. 

Different skyboxes can be loaded in by placing images in the Skybox folder. It is a requirement that there are six images in each skybox folder, each containing the names "top", "bottom", "left", "right", "front" and "back". You can also place textures in the texture folder and it will automatically show up in the texture library.


## Your first website

**GitHub Pages** is a free and easy way to create a website using the code that lives in your GitHub repositories. You can use GitHub Pages to build a portfolio of your work, create a personal website, or share a fun project that you coded with the world. GitHub Pages is automatically enabled in this repository, but when you create new repositories in the future, the steps to launch a GitHub Pages website will be slightly different.

## Rename this repository to publish your site

We've already set-up a GitHub Pages website for you, based on your personal username. This repository is called `hello-world`, but you'll rename it to: `username.github.io`, to match your website's URL address. If the first part of the repository doesn’t exactly match your username, it won’t work, so make sure to get it right.

Let's get started! To update this repository’s name, click the `Settings` tab on this page. This will take you to your repository’s settings page.

Under the **Repository Name** heading, type: `username.github.io`, where username is your username on GitHub. Then click **Rename**—and that’s it. When you’re done, click your repository name or browser’s back button to return to this page.

Once you click **Rename**, your website will automatically be published at: https://your-username.github.io/. The HTML file—called `index.html`—is rendered as the home page and you'll be making changes to this file in the next step.

Congratulations! You just launched your first GitHub Pages website. It's now live to share with the entire world

## Making your first edit

When you make any change to any file in your project, you’re making a **commit**. If you fix a typo, update a filename, or edit your code, you can add it to GitHub as a commit. Your commits represent your project’s entire history—and they’re all saved in your project’s repository.

With each commit, you have the opportunity to write a **commit message**, a short, meaningful comment describing the change you’re making to a file. So you always know exactly what changed, no matter when you return to a commit.
